Project Llander
A Prototype

By: Jovan Aleksic

Project Llander is a sidescrolling lander type of game where the player navigates asteroid mazes and tries to reach the end.
The player can pick up extra fuel canisters along the way. 

The player's rotation is controlled with the A and D keys. The player can boost by holding the space key, finally the player can "jump" by pressing the Left Shift key.

The game persists data through a custom serialization system I had made some time ago. The code for data persistence is based on the one taught in courses by GameDev.tv with minor adjustments made by me. The core objects are all collected in one prefab. Managers persist
